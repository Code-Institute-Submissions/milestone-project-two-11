## User Experience Design
### **The Strategy Plane**
This website was created to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript and to provide users with some entertainment in the form of an online Hangman game created with JavaScript and SVG and jQuery. The game should be easy to understand, simple to interactive with and give feedback to the user on all inputs.

Site Goals:
* To showcase the skills I have learnt in HTML, CSS, JS.
* To provide users with an interactive game to play that has clear Win / Lose Scenarios.
* To create an enjoyable, interactive game that makes the user want to stay and play again.
* To create a game that makes the user want to return to the website.

#### User stories
* As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
* As a user, I want to view the website and content clearly on my any device.
* As a user, I want to be able to play a game that contains instructions so that I understand how to play.
* As a user, I want to know whether my guess was successful or not.
* As a user, I want a way to start a new game when the current game has ended.
* As a user, I want to see my score so that I know how many games I have won or lost.
